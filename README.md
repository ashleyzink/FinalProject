* Jourdan's Lessons Learned:
During this final project taught me a lot about my self growth from the start of this bootcamp. I have learned so much in the last 16 weeks that I ever thought I was capable of being able to do. Being able to build a Full-Stack Application from start to finish was probably the most rewarding part of this project. I learned a lot about patience, trusting the process, and most importantly communicating with my team. When one of us need assistance we would SWARM/Pair Programming to help keeping moving the project forward. We all worked well as a team and collectively had really good ideas for the end product. I learned that I need to spend a little more time on Angular and that is what I will be doing after graduation. I am very proud of myself for consistently pushing  myself, never giving up, and humbled for how far I have come. Making a complete career change from Sales into Computer Programming has been the best decision I ever made!
